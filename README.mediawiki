Monitoring for [http://incubator.apache.org/cloudstack/ Apache CloudStack] and by extension, [http://www.citrix.com/products/cloudplatform/overview.html Citrix CloudPlatform].

The easiest way to start monitoring CloudStack is to navigate to the Infrastructure page, click the *+* menu to add a device and choose ''Add CloudStack''. Fill out the ''URL'', ''API Key'', and ''Secret Key'' fields then click ''OK''. The URL should only include the protocol, host and port (i.e. ''http://cloudstack.example.com/''). You can find or create the keys by logging into the CloudStack web interface and navigate to Accounts and users.

Zenoss will then add the CloudStack device to the system along with all of its associated zones, pods, clusters, system VMs and VMs. Monitoring will also start after the discovery is complete.

== Metrics ==

Once you've successfully added a CloudStack cloud to Zenoss you will begin to see the following metrics available for the entire cloud. These numbers are aggregated from all zones, pods, clusters and hosts.

* Public IPs: Total and Used
* Private IPs: Total and Used
* Memory: Total (with and without over-provisioning), Allocated and Used
* CPU: Total (with and without over-provisioning), Allocated and Used
* Primary Storage: Total (with and without over-provisioning), Allocated and Used
* Secondary Storage: Total and Used
* Network: Read and Write


The same list of metrics are available for each zone. The same metrics with the exception of public IPs and secondary storage are also available for each pod.

The following metrics are available aggregated to each cluster, and for each host.

* Memory: Total and Used
* CPU: Total (with and without over-provisioning), Allocated, Used and Cores
* Network: Read and Write

== Events ==

CloudStack has both alerts and events. Once you've successfully added a CloudStack cloud to Zenoss you will automatically receive all CloudStack alerts as events in Zenoss. You will also automatically receive all CloudStack events. However, the events will go straight into your event history by default.

To avoid overloading CloudStack and Zenoss, only the last two (2) days of events will be checked. This allows for timezone discrepency between the Zenoss and CloudStack servers as well as some downtime without missing events. There is no real-time event collection mechanism with the CloudStack API, so alerts and events will only be polled once per minute.

Installing the ZenPack will add the following items to your Zenoss system.
